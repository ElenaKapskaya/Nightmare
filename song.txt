I had a pet once
It wasn't good for me
I don't want a little thing
To take away my sleep
I have a little itch
I scratch until I bleed
And I don't want a little thing
To take away my sleep (I just wanna get dirty)
Oh, pretty bug
Hanging out underneath my feet
When I move forward I end you
And that sits well with me
